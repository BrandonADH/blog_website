## Hello, World!

### Who Am I?
My name is Brandon, and I'm an aspiring Electrical (or Software) Computer Engineer. I'm always interested in hardware, and how it works. I love messing around with low level programming, and other random projects, but recently have been stuck with trying to find something. If any of you need a helper or assistant for programming, feel free to reach out to me on my email brandon@brandonhoward.xyz, cause I am interested. I'm currently in HS, and am graduating next year. 

### What is this website for?
This website is for my random thoughts and ideas to be shared for everyone throughout the internet. I had this url under something different but now that I have something nicer setup, I think that I'll finally be able to post things more frequently, and have alot more fun with programming, and learning.

### How did you make this website anyways?
I made this using Hugo, with the Lekh Theme. It's currently being hosted on Azure Static Web Apps. 

## Conclusion

Honestly, if you want to follow, go ahead, cause that would be cool and you get to see my random shenanigans. Otherwise, I really think that this website is going to hopefully be somewhere that you will look forward in checking every so often, because that would be pretty cool. See you on the flip side!
